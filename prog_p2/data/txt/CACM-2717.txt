CONVERT: A High Level Translation
Definition Language for Data Conversion
This paper describes a high level and nonprocedural
translation definition language, CONVERT,
which provides very powerful and highly flexible data
restructuring capabilities. Its design is based
on the simple underlying concept of a form which enables
the users to visualize the translation processes,
and thus makes data translation a much simpler task.
"CONVERT" has been chosen for conveying the purpose
of the language and should not be confused with any
other language or program bearing the same name.
