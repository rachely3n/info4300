Evaluation and Selection of File Organization-A Model and System
This work first discusses the factors that
affect file (data base) organization performance,
an elusive subject, and then presents a methodology, a
model and a programmed system to estimate primarily
total storage costs and average access time of several
file organizations, given a specific data base,
query characterization and device-related specifications.
Based on these estimates, an appropriate file
structure may be selected for the specific situation.
The system is a convenient tool to study file
structures and to facilitate as much as possible the process
of data base structure design and evaluation.
