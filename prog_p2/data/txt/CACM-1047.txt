Generation of Test Matrices by Similarity Transformations
A method for obtaining test matrices with
a prescribed distribution of characteristic roots
is given.  The process consists of using particularly
simple similarity transformations to generate full
matrices from canonical forms.  The matrices generated
also have known characteristic vectors, inverses
and determinants.
