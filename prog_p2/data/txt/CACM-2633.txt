Compact Representation of Contour Plots for Phone Line Transmission
Methods for the compact representation of contour
plots are described and tested.  These are
intended to reduce the cost of transmitting contour plots
over phone lines.  We feel some of these methods
could be used to transmit contour plots over voice grade phone lines.
