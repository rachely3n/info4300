A Comparative Evaluation of Versions of BASIC
From its inception, The BASIC language has
grown in terms of its usage, scope of usage, and
its features.  This article compares ten of the current
versions of BASIC with each other, with two earlier
versions, and with the proposed standard for minimal
BASIC. The comparison is arranged by the features
of the versions and by computational comparison
of computation and times and processing costs.
