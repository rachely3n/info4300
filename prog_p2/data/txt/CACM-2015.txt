A Technique for Generating Almost Optimal
Floyd-Evans Productions for Precedence Grammars
A technique is developed for generating almost optimal Floyd-Evans productions
given a precedence grammar. A graph formulation is used for the problem of
merging productions.  The productions generated correspond to the minimum cost
inverse-arborescence of that graph.  The validity of the technique is
demonstrated for weak precedence grammars defined here, but the productions
mechanically generated for any precedence grammar can often be modified in
such a way that correct, almost optimal parsers are obtained.
