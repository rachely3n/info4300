Mixed Solutions for the Deadlock Problem
Mixtures of detection, avoidance, and prevention
provide more effective and practical solutions
to the deadlock problem than any one of these alone.  The
individual techniques can be tailored for subproblems
of resource allocation and still operate together to
prevent deadlocks.  This paper presents a method,
based on the concept of the hierarchical operating
system, for constructing appropriate mixtures and
suggests appropriate subsystems for the most frequently
occurring resource allocation problems
