A General Purpose Graphic Language
Interactive use of computers with graphic terminals
will permit many new problems to be solved
using machines.  In order to handle a variety of applications,
it is expedient to develop a general purpose
graphic language that is useful on a number of graphic
devices.  A system has been designed to produce
such a language quickly and cheaply.  A model graphic
language which has been developed with the system
is presented.
