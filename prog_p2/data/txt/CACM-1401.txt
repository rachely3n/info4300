Quasilinearization and the Calculation of Eigenvalues
Several eigenvalue problems for systems of
ordinary differential equations are considered.
They are resolved computationally using the quasilinerization
technique, a quadratically convergent
successive approximation scheme related to
the Newton-Raphson-Kantorovich method.
