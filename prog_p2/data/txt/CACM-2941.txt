Early Experience with Mesa
The experiences of Mesa's first users-primarily
its implementers-are discussed, and some implications
for Mesa and similar programming languages are suggested.
The specific topics addressed are: module structure
and its use in defining abstractions, data-structuring
facilities in Mesa, an equivalence algorithm for
types and type coercions, the benefits of the type system
and why it is breached occasionally, and the
difficulty of making the treatment of variant records safe.
