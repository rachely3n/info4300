A Comparison of Numerical Techniques in Markov Modeling
This paper presents several numerical methods which
may be used to obtain the stationary probability
vectors of Markovian models.  An example of a nearly
decomposable system is considered, and the results
obtained by the different methods examined.  A post
mortem reveals why standard techniques often fail
to yield the correct results.  Finally, a means of estimating
the error inherent in the decomposition
of certain models is presented.
