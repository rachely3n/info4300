Multiple Byte Processing with Full-Word Instructions
A method is described which allows parallel
processing of packed data items using only ordinary
full-word computer instructions, even though the processing
requires operations whose execution is contingent
upon the value of a datum.  It provides a useful technique
for processing small data items such as alphanumeric
characters.
