Virtual Memory, Processes, and Sharing in MULTICS
Some basic concepts involved in the design
of the MULTICS operating system are introduced.
MULTICS concepts of processes, address space, and virtual
memory are defined and the use of paging and
segmentation is explained.  The means by which users
may share procedures and data is discussed and the
mechanism by which symbolic references are dynamically
transformed into virtual machine addresses is
described in detail.
