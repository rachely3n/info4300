Empirical Working Set Behavior
The working set model for program behavior
has been proposed in recent years as a basis for
the design of scheduling and paging algorithms.  Although
the words "working set" are now commonly encountered
in the literature dealing with resource allocation, there
is a dearth of published data on program measurements,
in the hope that workers in the field might find experimental
evidence upon which to substantiate and
base theoretical work.
