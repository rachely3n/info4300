A Tape File Merge Pattern Generator
A routine is presented which specifies the
sequence of merge cycles to effect the merging of
sorted tape files.  The routine is designed to minimize
elapsed computer time by varying the power of
the merge cycles, so as to use all the available tape
drives, with its characteristic of assigning one
drive to a single-reel file and two drives to each multiple-reel file.
