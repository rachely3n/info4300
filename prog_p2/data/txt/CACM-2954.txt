A Bounded Storage Algorithm for Copying Cyclic Structures
A new algorithm is presented which copies cyclic
list structures using bounded workspace and
linear time. Unlike a previous similar algorithm, this
one makes no assumptions about the storage allocation
system in use and uses only operations likely to be available
in a high-level language.  The distinctive
feature of this algorithm is a technique for traversing
the structure twice, using the same spanning
tree in each case, first from left to right and then from right to left.
