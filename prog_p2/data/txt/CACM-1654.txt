A University's Educational Program in Computer Science
After a review of the power of contemporary computers,
computer science is defined in several
ways.  The objectives of computer science education are
stated, and it is asserted that in a North American
university these will be achieved only through a computer
science department.  The program at Stanford
University is reviewed as an example.  The appendices
include syllabic of Ph. qualifying examinations
for Stanford's Computer Science Department.
