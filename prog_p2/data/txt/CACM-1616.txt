Tensor Calculations on Computer: Appendix
In the main text of the paper [Comm. ACM 9,
12 (Dec. 196), 864], a FORMAC program was discussed
which is capable of calculating various quantities
of interest in tensor calculus.  This Appendix is
intended as an example of the program output.  Chrisoffel
symbols calculated for 12 basic orthogonal
coordinate systems are listed.
