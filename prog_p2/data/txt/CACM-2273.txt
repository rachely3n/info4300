Conversion of Decision Tables By Rule Mask Method Without Rule Mask
Two algorithms for generating computer programs
from decision tables are described.  The algorithms
allow handling limited entry, extended entry, and mixed
entry tables.  The algorithms are based on the
rule mask method but need not have the masks at execution
time.  They perform the logical operations
immediately rather than at the end of the interpreting
process.  Execution time can be considerably reduced
by instantly marking rules which are not applicable (Algorithms
1 and 2) or conditions which are already
tested (Algorithm 2).  The new algorithms combine to a
certain degree the advantages of mask methods with
those of tree methods.
