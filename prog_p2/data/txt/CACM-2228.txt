Comments on Prevention of System Deadlocks
Habermann's method of deadlock prevention is
discussed, where deadlock is defined as a system
state from which resource allocations to certain processes
are not possible.  It is shown that the scheduler
may introduce "artificial" deadlocks which Habermann's
method does not prevent.  Permanent blocking is
the situation where certain processes never receive their
resource requests.  It is shown that deadlock
prevention does not necessarily eliminate permanent blocking.
A method of preventing permanent blocking
is given.
