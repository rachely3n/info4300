An Exercise in Proving Parallel Programs Correct
A parallel program, Dijkstra's on-the-fly garbage
collector, is proved correct using a proof
method developed by Owicki.  The fine degree of in terleaving
in this program makes it especially difficult
to understand, and complicates the proof greatly.  Difficulties
with proving such parallel programs correct
are discussed.
