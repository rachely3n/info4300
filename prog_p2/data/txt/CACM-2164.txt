Symbolic Integration: The Stormy Decade
Three approaches to symbolic integration in the
1960's are described.  The first, from artificial
intelligence, led to Slagle's SAINT and to a large
degree to Moses' SIN.  The second, from algebraic
manipulation, led to Manove's implementation and to
Horowitz' and Tobey's reexamination of the Hermite
algorithm for integrating rational functions.  The third,
from mathematics, led to Richardson's proof
of the unsolvability of the problem for a class of functions
and for Risch's decision procedure for the
elementary functionseneralizations of Risch's algorithm
to a class of special functions and programs
for solving differential equations and for finding
the definite integral are also described.
