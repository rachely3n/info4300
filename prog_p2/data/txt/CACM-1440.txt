Starting Approximations for Square Root Calculation on IBM System/360
Several starting approximations for square
root calculation by Newton's method are presented
in a form to facilitate their use in IBM System/360 square
root routines.  These approximations include
several for the range [1/16, 1], which is the interval
of primary interest on IBM System/360.
