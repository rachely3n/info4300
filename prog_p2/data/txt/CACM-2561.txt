A Heuristic Approach to Inductive Inference in Fact Retrieval Systems
Heuristic procedures are presented which have
been developed to perform inferences by generalizing
from available information.  The procedures make use
of a similarity structure which is imposed on the
data base using nonnumerical clustering algorithms.  They
are implemented in a model fact retrieval system
which uses a formal query language and a property-list data
structure.  A program of experiments is described
wherein the procedures are used with test data bases
which are altered by deleting part of the data and
by purposely introducing false data.  It is found that
the system can infer the correct response under
a variety of conditions involving incomplete and inconsistent data.
