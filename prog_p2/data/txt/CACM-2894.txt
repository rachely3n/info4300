A Methodology for Interactive Computer Service Measurement
A measurement methodology applicable to in teractive
computer service is described.  Its primary
purpose is to enable external, user-oriented assessment
of computer performance, instead of the more
frequently used in ternal system measurement techniques.
The NBS Network Measurement System is employed
as the external measurement tool.  Example data have
been collected and analyzed.  A demonstration of
the methodology, leading to a pragmatic figure-of-merit
evaluation of results, is included.
