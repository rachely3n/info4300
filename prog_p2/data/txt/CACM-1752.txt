Resource Management for a Medium Scale Time-Sharing Operating system
Task scheduling and resource balancing for
a medium size virtual memory paging machine are
discussed in relation to a combined batch processing
and time-sharing environment.  A synopsis is given
of the task scheduling and paging algorithms that were implemented,
and the results of comparative simulation
are given by tracing the development of the algorithms
through six predecessor versions.  Throughout
the discussion particular emphasis is placed on balancing
the system performance relative to the characteristics
of all the system resources.  Simulation results relative
to alternate hardware characteristics and the
effects of program mix and loading variations are also presented.
