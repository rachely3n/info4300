A Simple Recovery-Only Procedure For SImple Precedence Parsers
A simple method is described enabling simple
precedence parsers to recover from syntax errors.
No attempt to repair errors is made, yet parsing and
most semantic processing can continue.  The result
is a good "first approximation" to syntax error handling
with negligible increase in parsing time, space,
and complexity of both the parser and its table generator.
