Backtrack Programming Techniques
The purpose of this paper is twofold.  First,
a brief exposition of the general backtrack technique
and its history is given.  Second, it is shown how the use
of macros can considerably shorten the computation
time in many cases.  In particular, this technique has allowed
the solution of two previously open combinatorial
problems, the computation of new terms in a well-known
series, and the substantial reduction in computation
time for the solution to another combinatorial problem.
