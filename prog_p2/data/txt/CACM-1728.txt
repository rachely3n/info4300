Further Experimental Data on the Behavior
of Programs in a Paging Environment
Results are summarized from an empirical study
directed at the measurement of program operating
behavior in those multiprogramming systems in which
programs are organized into fixed length pages.
The data collected from the interpretive execution of
a number of paged programs are used to describe
the frequency of page faults, i.e. the frequency of those
instants at which an executing program requires
a page of data or instructions not in main (core) memory.
These data are used also for the evaluation
of page replacement algorithms and for assessing the
effects on performance of changes in the amount
of storage allocated to executing programs.
