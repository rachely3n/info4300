The Humble Programmer
We shall do a much better programming job, provided that we approach the
task with a full appreciation if its tremendous difficulty, provided that we
stick to modest and elegant programming languages, provided that we respect
the intrinsic limitations of the human mind and approach the task as Very
Humble Programmers.
