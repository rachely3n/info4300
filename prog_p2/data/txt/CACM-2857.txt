Referencing Lists by an Edge
An edge reference into a list structure is a pair
of pointers to adjacent nodes.  Such a reference
often requires little additional space, but its use can
yield efficient algorithms. For instance, a circular
link between the ends of a list is redundant if the list
is always referenced by that edge, and list traversal
is easier when that link is null.  Edge references also
allow threading of nonrecursive lists, can replace
some header cells, and enhance the famous
exclusive-or-trick to double-link lists
