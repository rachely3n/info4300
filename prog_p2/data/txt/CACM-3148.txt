High Level Programming for Distributed Computing
Programming for distributed and other loosely coupled systems
is a problem of growing interest.  This paper describes an approach
to distributed computing at the level of general purpose programming
languages.  Based on primitive notions of module, message,
and transaction key, the methodology is shown to be independent
of particular languages and machines.  It appears to be useful for
programming a wide range of tasks.  This is part of an ambitious
program of development in advanced programming languages, and relations
with other aspects of the project are also discussed.
