Analysis and performance of Inverted Data Base Structures
The need to envision and architecture data base
systems in a hierarchical level by level framework
is stressed. The inverted data base (file) organization
is then analyzed, considering implementation
oriented aspects.  The inverted directory is viewed realistically
as another large data base which itself
is subjected to inversion.  Formulations are derived
to estimate average access time (read only) and
storage requirements, formalizing the interaction of data
base content characteristics, logical complexity
of queries, and machine timing and blocking specifications
identified as having a first-order effect
on performance.  The formulations presented are necessary
to be used in conjunction with any index selection
criteria to determine the optimum set of index keys.
