The Synthetic Approach to Decision Table Conversion
Previous approaches to the problem of automatically
converting decision tables to computer
programs have been based on decomposition.  At any
stage, one condition is selected for testing, and
two smaller problems (decision tables with one less
condition) are created.  An optimal program (with
respect to average execution time or storage space, for
example) is located only through implicit enumeration
of all possible decision trees using a technique such
as branch-and-bound.  The new approach described
in this paper uses dynamic programming to synthesize
an optimal decision tree from which a program can
be created.  Using this approach, the efficiency of creating
an optimal program is increased substantially,
permitting generation of optimal programs for decision
tables with as many as ten to twelve conditions.
