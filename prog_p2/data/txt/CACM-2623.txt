A New Technique for Compression and Storage of Data
The widespread tendency toward storage of
large programs and blocks off text has produced a
need for efficient methods of compressing and storing
data.  This paper describes techniques that can,
in most cases, decrease storage size by a factor of
from two to four.  The techniques involve special
handling of leading and trailing blanks, and the encoding
of other symbols in groups of fixed size as
unique fixed point numbers.  The efficiency of the
system is considered and pertinent statistics are
given and compared with statistics for other information coding techniques.
