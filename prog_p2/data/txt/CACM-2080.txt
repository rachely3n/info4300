The Nucleus of a Multiprogramming System
This paper describes the philosophy and structure of a multiprogramming system
that can be extended with a hierarchy of operating systems to suit diverse
requirements of program scheduling and resource allocation.  The system
nucleus simulates an environment in which program execution and input/output
are handled uniformly as parallel, cooperating process
es.  A fundamental set of primitives allows the dynamic creation and control
of a hierarchy of processes as well as the communication among them.
