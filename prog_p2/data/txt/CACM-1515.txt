A Computer System for Inference Execution and Data Retrieval
This paper presents a RAND project concerned
with the use of computers as assistants in the
logical analysis of large collections of factual data.
A system called Relational Data File was developed
for this purpose.  The Relational Data File is briefly
detailed and problems arising from its implementation
are discussed.
