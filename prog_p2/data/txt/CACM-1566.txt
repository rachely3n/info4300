Optimal Starting Values for Newton-Raphson Calculation of SQRT(x)
The problem of obtaining starting values for
the Newton-Raphson calculation of SQRT(x) on a
digital computer is considered.  It is shown that the
conventionally used best uniform approximations
to SQRT(x) do not provide optimal starting values.
The problem of obtaining optimal starting values.
The problem of obtaining optimal starting values is
stated, and several basic results are proved.  A
table of optimal polynomial starting values is given.
