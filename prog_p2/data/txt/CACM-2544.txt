Automatic Error bounds for Simple Zeros of Analytic Functions
The Cauchy-Ostrowski theorem on convergence
of Newton iterates for an analytic function in
one variable is extended to include computational errors
using complex interval arithmetic. Several numerical
examples are given for polynomials with real and complex
roots and one example for the Bessel function
of the first kind.
