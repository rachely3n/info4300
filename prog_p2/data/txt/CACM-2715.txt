Implementation of a Structured English Query Language
The relational model of data, the XRM Relational
Memory System, and the SEQUEL language have
been covered in previous papers and are reviewed.
SEQUEL is a relational data sublanguages intended
for the ad hoc interactive problem solving by non-computer
specialists.  A version of SEQUEL that has
been implemented in a prototype interpreter is described.
The interpreter is designed to minimize the
data accessing operations required to respond to an arbitrary
query.  The optimization algorithms designed
for this purpose are described.
