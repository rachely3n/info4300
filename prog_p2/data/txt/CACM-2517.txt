Some Comments on the Use of Ambiguous Decision
Tables and Their Conversion to Computer Programs
This paper comments upon recently published
work on decision table translation using methods
similar to the rule-mask technique.  The applicability
of these methods under various possible conventions
on overall table meaning is discussed, and it is argued
that there is a place both for the multi-rule
and the single-rule (or action set) convention in decision tale usage.
