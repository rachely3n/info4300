The Quadratic Hash Method When the Table Size Is Not a Prime Number
Previous work on quadratic hash methods is
limited mainly to the case where the table size
is a prime number.  Here, certain results are derived for
composite numbers.  It is shown that all composite
numbers containing at least the square of one of the component
primes have full-period integer-coefficient
quadratic hash functions.
