An Improved Hash Code for Scatter Storage
Introduced is a hash coding method based on
fixed-point division rather than multiplication
or logical operations.  This new method allows the
hash table to have almost any length.  Also a new
method of handling collisions is discussed.  Known as
quadratic search, this method is faster than random
search and free from the "clusters" that build up with a linear search.
