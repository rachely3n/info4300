The Use of Grammatical Inference for Designing Programming Languages
Both in designing a new programming language
and in extending an existing language, the designer
is faced with the problem of deriving a "natural" grammar
for the language.  We are proposing an interactive
approach to the grammar design problem wherein the designer
presents a sample of sentences and structures
as input to a grammatical inference algorithm.  The algorithm
then constructs a grammar which is a reasonable
generalization of the examples submitted by the designer.
The implementation is presently restricted
to a subclass of operator precedence grammars, but
a second algorithm is outlined which applies to a
larger class of context-free grammars.
