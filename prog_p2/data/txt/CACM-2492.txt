The Development of Decision Tables via
Parsing of Complex Decision Situations
A new parsing technique is proposed which allows
parsing based only on syntactical characteristics
of the decision problem.  It requires a description
of the problem in decision grid chart format and
allows the development of decision tables within defined
limits by avoiding, or at least minimizing,
repetition of conditions and actions in the resulting tables.
