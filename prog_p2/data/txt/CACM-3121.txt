Syntactic Source to Source Transforms and Program Manipulation
Syntactic transforms are the source to source program transformations
which preserve the history of computation, and thus do not
modify the execution time.  Combined with a small number of primitive
semantic transforms, they provide a powerful tool for program
manipulation.  A catalogue of syntactic transforms, and its use for
solution of a system of program equations, is given.  Examples of
derivation of more complex source to source transformations are also
presented.  Two case studies illustrate the way in which syntactic
and semantic source to source transformations may be used for
development of clear, simple, and reasonably efficient programs.
