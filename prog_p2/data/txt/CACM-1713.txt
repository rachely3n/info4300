On Overcoming High-Priority Paralysis
in Multiprogramming Systems: A Case His tory
High-priority paralysis is the degradation
that can occur in multiprogramming systems when
scheduling is based primarily on preassigned priorities.
It can be alleviated by modifying the scheduling
algorithm to maximize the number of programs active
at one time.  The case his tory given in this paper
indicates two general methods by which simultaneity can
be increased.  Possible refinements in the scheduling
algorithm for future improvements are considered briefly.
