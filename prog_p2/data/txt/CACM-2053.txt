On the Conversion of Decision Tables to Computer Programs
The use of execution time diagnostics in pinpointing ambiguities in decision
tables is discussed.  It is pointed out that any attempt at resolving
ambiguities at compile time will, in general, be impossible.  It
is shown that, as a consequence, tree methods of converting decision
tables to programs are inadequate in regard to ambiguity detection.
Two algorithms for programming decision tables whose merits
are simplicity of implementation and detection of ambiguities at
execution time are presented. The first algorithm is for limited entry
decision tables and clarifies the importance of proper coding
of the information in the decision table.  The second algorithm programs
a mixed entry decision table directly without going through
the intermediate step of conversion to a limited entry form, thereby
resulting in storage economy.  A comparison of the algorithms and others
proposed in the literature is made.  Some features of a decision table
to Fortran IV translator for the IBM 7044 developed by the authors are given.
