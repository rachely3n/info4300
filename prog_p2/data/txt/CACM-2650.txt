Order-n Correction for Regular Languages
A method is presented for calculating a string
B, belonging to a given regular language L,
which is "nearest" (in number of edit operations) to a
given input string a.  B is viewed as a reasonable
"correction" for the possibly erroneous string a, where
a was originally intended to be a string of L.
The calculation of B by the method presented requires
time proportional to |a|, the number of characters
in a.  The method should find applications in information
retrieval, artificial intelligence, and spelling
correction systems.
