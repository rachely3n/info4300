The Predictive Analyzer and a Path Elimination Technique
Some of the characteristic features of a predictive
analyzer, a system of syntactic analysis
now operational at Harvard on and IBM 7094, are delineated.
The advantages and disadvantages of the
system are discussed in comparison to those of an immediate
constituent analyzer, developed at the RAND
Corporation with Robinson's English grammar.  In addition,
a new technique is described for repetitive
path elimination for a predictive analyzer, which can
now claim efficiency both in processing time and
core storage requirement.
