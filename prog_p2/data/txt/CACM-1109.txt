Conversion of a Power to a Series of Chebyshev Polynomials*
Even slowly convergent power series can be
rearranged as series in Chebyshev polynomials if
appropriate sequence transformations are used in evaluating
the coefficients.  The method is illustrated
by computing the coefficients for the expansion
of the logarithm and dilogarithm.
