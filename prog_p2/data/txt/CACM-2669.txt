A Simple Linear Model of Demand Paging Performance
Predicting the performance of a proposed automatically
managed multilevel memory system requires
a model of the patterns by which programs refer to the
information stored in the memory.  Some recent
experimental measurements on the Multics virtual memory
suggest that, for rough approximations, a remarkably
simple program reference model will suffice.  The simple
model combines the effect of the information
reference pattern with the effect of the automatic management
algorithm to produce a single, composite
statement: the mean number of memory references between
paging exceptions increases linearly with the
size of the paging memory.  The resulting model is easy
to manipulate, and is applicable to such diverse
problems as choosing an optimum size for a paging memory,
arranging for reproducible memory usage charges,
and estimating the amount of core memory sharing.
