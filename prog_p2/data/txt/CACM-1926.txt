Description of FORMAT, a Text-Processing Program
FORMAT is a production program which facilitates
the editing and printing of "finished" documents
directly on the printer of a relatively small (64k) computer
system.  It features good performance, totally
free-form input, very flexible formatting capabilities
including up to eight columns per page, automatic
capitalization, aids for index construction, and a
minimum of nontext items.  It is written entirely
in FORTRAN IV.
