Modularization and Hierarchy in a Family of Operating Systems
This paper describes the design philosophy
used in the construction of a family of operating
systems. It is shown that the concepts of module and
level do not coincide in a hierarchy of functions.
Family members can share much software as a result
of the implementation of run-time modules at the
lowest system level.
