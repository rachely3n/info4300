TENEX, a Paged Time Sharing System for the PDP-10
TENEX is a new time sharing system implemented
on DEC PDP-10 augmented by special paging hardware
developed at BBN.  This report specifies a set of goals
which are important for any time sharing system.
It describes how the TENEX design and implementation
achieve these goals.  These include specifications
for a powerful multiprocess large memory virtual machine,
intimate terminal interaction, comprehensive
uniform file and I/O capabilities, and clean flexible
system structure.  Although the implementation
described here required some compromise to achieve a
system operational within six months of hardware
checkout, TENEX has met its major goals and provided
reliable service at several sites and through the
ARPA network.
