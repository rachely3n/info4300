Degree of Multiprogramming in Page-on-Demand Systems
A simple stochastic model is described which
offers a base for understanding the relationship
between the number of programs permitted to share memory
(the degree of multiprogramming), drum traffic
rates, and central processing unit utilization in page-on-demand,
multiprogrammed, time-shared computer
systems.  The model preserves, as a key feature, the
property of page-demand statistics which implies
a "burst" of page demands at the beginning of any job
or quantum execution.  The model, a Markov chain,
is analyzed numerically and the results are presented graphically
for a wide range of key environment-descriptive
parameters.  Implications of the results to time-shared
system design and programming are discussed,
and a calculation of the optimal degree of multiprogramming
for a wide range of parameters is presented
graphically.
