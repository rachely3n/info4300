The Reallocation of Hash-Coded Tables
When the space allocation for a hash-coded table
is altered, the table entries must be rescattered
over the new space.  A technique for accomplishing
this rescattering is presented.  The technique is
independent of both the length of the table and the hashing
function used, and can be utilized in conjunction
with a linear reallocation of the table being rescattered.
Moreover, it can be used to eliminate previously
flagged deletions from any hash-coded table, or to change
from one hashing method to another.  The efficiency
of the technique is discussed and theoretical statistics are given.
