General Performance Analysis of Key-to-Address
Transformation Methods Using an Abstract File
Concept
This paper presents a new approach to the analysis
of performance of the various key-to-address
transformation methods.  In this approach the keys in
a file are assumed to have been selected from the
key space according to a certain probabilistic selection
algorithm.  All files with the same number of
keys selected from this key space will be suitably weighted
in accordance with the algorithm, and the
average performance of the transformation methods on
these files will be used as the potential of these
methods.  Using this analysis, methods with the same overall
performance can be classified and key distributions
partial to certain transformations can be identified.
All this can be done analytically.  The approach
is applied to a group of transformation methods
using files whose keys are selected randomly.
