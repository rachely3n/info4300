The Evolution of Storage Structures
Data base management systems have grown rapidly
in their power and complexity over the 15-year
history of data processing on commercially available
computers.  The original concepts have split, and
new terms have been adopted to name and refer to these
concepts.  The Data Structure Diagram graphic
technique is used to illustrate the splitting of the
concepts and the structural relations which exist
between these concepts at each point in the evolution.
