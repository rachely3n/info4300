Buddy Systems
Two algorithms are presented for implementing
any of a class of buddy systems for dynamic storage
allocation.  Each buddy system corresponds to a set of
recurrence relations which relate the block sizes
provided to each other. Analyses of the in ternal fragmentation
of the binary buddy system, the Fibonacci
buddy system, and the weighted buddy system are given.
Comparative simulation results are also presented
for in ternal, external, and total fragmentation.
