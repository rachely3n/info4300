Proving Monitors
Interesting scheduling and sequential properties
of monitors can be proved by using state variables
which record the monitor's history and by defining extended
proof rules for their wait and signal operations.
These two techniques are defined, discussed, and applied
to examples to prove properties such as freedom
from indefinitely repeated overtaking or unnecessary waiting
upper bounds on queue lengths, and historical
behavior.
