A Note on the Efficiency of a LISP Computation in a Paged Machine
The problem of the use of two levels of storage
for programs is explored in the context of
a LISP system which uses core memory as a buffer for
a large virtual memory stored on a drum.  Details
of timing are given for one particular problem.
