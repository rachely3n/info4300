Optimizing Binary Trees Grown With a Sorting Algorithm
Items can be retrieved from binary trees grown
with a form of the Algorithm Quicksort in an
average time proportional to log n, where n is the number
of items in the tree.  The binary trees grown
by this algorithm sometimes have some branches longer
than others; therefore, it is possible to reduce
the average retrieval time by restructuring the tree to
make the branches as uniform in length as possible.
An algorithm to do this is presented.  The use of this
algorithm is discussed, and it is compared with
another which restructures the tree after each new item is added.
