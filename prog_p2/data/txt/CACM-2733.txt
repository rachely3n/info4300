Deterministic Parsing of Ambiguous Grammars
Methods of describing the syntax of programming
languages in ways that are more flexible and
natural than conventional BNF descriptions are considered.
These methods involve the use of ambiguous
context-free grammars together with rules to resolve
syntactic ambiguities.  It is shown how efficient
LR and LL parsers can be constructed directly from
certain classes of these specifications.
