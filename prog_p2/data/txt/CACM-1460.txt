Evolution of the Meta-Assembly Program
A generalized assembler called a "meta-assembler"
is described.  The meta-assembler is defined
and factors which contributed to its evolution are presented.
How a meta-assembler is made to function
as an assembly program is described. Finally, the implication
of meta-assemblers on compiler design is
discussed.
