User Program Measurement in a Time-Shared Environment
A general discussion of the measurement of
software systems is followed by a description of
a hardware and software scheme for measuring user programs
in a time-shared environment.  The TX-2 computer
at MIT Lincoln Laboratory was used for the implementation
of such a system and the characteristics of
this implementation are reported.  A scenario showing
the system in use is presented.  Finally, it is
shown how other time-sharing systems may provide similar measuring facilities.
