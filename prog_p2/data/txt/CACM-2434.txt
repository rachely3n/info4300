Using Page Residency To Select the Working Set Parameter
Denning's method for selecting the working set
parameter, which uses interreference intervals,
is examined.  Several omissions in his model are noted,
and new assumptions are introduced to overcome
these omissions.  Using this modified model, Dening's results
on page residency are rederived and reconsidered
for selecting the working set parameter.
