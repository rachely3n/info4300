An Insertion Technique for One-Sided Height-Balanced Trees
A restriction on height-balanced binary trees
is presented.  It is seen that this restriction
reduces the extra memory requirements by half (from
two extra bits per node to one) and maintains fast
search capabilities at a cost of increased
time requirements for inserting new nodes.
