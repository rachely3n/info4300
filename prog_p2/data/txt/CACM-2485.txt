Managing the Computer Resource: A Stage Hypothesis
Based on the study of expenditures for data processing,
a descriptive stage hypothesis is presented.
It is suggested that the planning, organizing, and controlling
activities associated with managing the
computer resource will change in character over a period
of time, and will evolve in patterns roughly
correlated to four stages of the computer budget: Stage
I (computer acquisition), Stage II (intense system
development), Stage III (proliferation of controls), and
Stage IV (user/service orientation).  Each stage
is described and related to individual tasks for managing the computer resource.
