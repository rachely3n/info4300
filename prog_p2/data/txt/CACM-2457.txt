Inductive Methodsfor Proving Properties of Programs
There are two main purposes in this paper:
first, clarification and extension of known results
about computation of recursive programs, with emphasis
on the difference between the theoretical and
practical approaches; second, presentation and examination
of various known methods for proving properties
of recursive programs.  Discussed in detail are two
powerful inductive methods computational induction
and structural induction, including examples of their applications.
