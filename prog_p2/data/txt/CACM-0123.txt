Compilation for Two Computers with NELIAC
NELIAC, a compiler based on ALGOL, was developed
at the U. Navy Electronics Laboratory, San
Diego,California, as a"boot-strap" compiler for the Remington
Rand Univac COUNTESS computer. This compiler
was used to generate a version of itself which, running
as a COUNTESS program, generated machine code
for the Control Data Corporation CDC-1604.  All three
versions of NELIAC accepted essentially identical
input language.
