Survey of Formula Manipulation
The field of formula manipulation is surveyed,
with particular attention to the specific capabilities
of differentiation, integration and the supporting capabilities
of simplification, displays and input/output
editing, and precision arithmetic.  General systems-both
batch and online-are described.  Finally, some
programs to solve specific applications are discussed.
