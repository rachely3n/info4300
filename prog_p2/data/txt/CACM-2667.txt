Execution Characteristics of Programs in a Page-on-Demand System
Data are presented which show the execution characteristics
of two types of commonly used programs
in a large-scale, time-shared computer system.  A software
monitoring facility built into the supervisor
was used for data collection during normal system operation.
These data were analyzed, and results of
this analysis are presented for a Fortran compiler
and an interactive line file editor.  Probability
distribution functions and other data are given for
such things as CPU intervals, I/O intervals, and
the number of such intervals during execution.  Empirical
distributions are compared with simple theoretical
distributions (exponential, hyperexponential, and geometric).
Other data show paging characteristics
of tasks as a function of the number of pages those tasks have in core.
