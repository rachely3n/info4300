On Multiprogramming, Machine Coding, and Computer Organization
The author feels that the interrupt feature
which is available in most modern computers is
a potent source of programming pitfalls and errors, and
that it therefore may heavily contribute to the
unreliability of programs making use of it.  A programming
scheme is presented which avoids the concept
of the interrupt and permits the specification of concurrent
(or pseudoconcurrent) activities in a supposedly
more perspicuous manner.  It is intended to serve as
a basis for the construction of operating systems,
which are prime examples of programs with concurrent
activities.  The scheme includes a set of basic
instructions for the generation, termination, and synchronization
of parallel processes.  A set of routines
representing these instructions and thereby simulating a
hypothetical machine organization has been implemented
and test on the IBM System/360.  Two programs using these
instructions, written in PL360, are presented.
