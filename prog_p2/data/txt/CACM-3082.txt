Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System
The concept of one event happening before
another in a distributed system is examined, and
is shown to define a partial ordering of the events.
A distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing
a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally
order the events.  The use of the total ordering
is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization
problems.  The algorithm is then specialized
for synchronizing physical clocks, and a bound is derived
on how far out of synchrony the clocks can
become.
