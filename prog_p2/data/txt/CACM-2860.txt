A Practitioner's Guide To Addressing Algorithms
This paper consolidates a number of popular
rules of thumb which have been suggested for the
design of record addressing algorithms, and discusses
the applicability of these rules to large commercial
databases.  Guidelines for selecting identifier transformations,
overflow techniques, loading factors,
bucket sizes, and loading order and considered.  Particular
attention is focused on the reasonableness
of common heuristics for determining primary or secondary
bucket sizes. A mathematical model which explicitly
considers storage device characteristics and time/space
cost tradeoffs is used to analyze the effect
of design parameters on overall system costs.  A
specific design example is presented and solved.
