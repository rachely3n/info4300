B-trees Re-examined
The B-tree and its variants have, with increasing
frequency, been proposed as a basic storage
structure for multiuser database applications.  Here,
three potential problems which must be dealt with
in such a structure that do not arise in more traditional
static directory structures are indicated.
One problem is a possible performance penalty.
