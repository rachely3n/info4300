Generation of Positive Test Matrices with Known Positive Spectra
Sufficient conditions are given for a real
matrix to be similar to a positive matrix.  This
result is used to construct a similarity transformation
which, when applied to a particular upper triangular
matrix, yields a positive matrix with a preassigned positive spectrum.
