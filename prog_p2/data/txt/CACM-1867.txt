On the Expected Lengths of Sequences Generated
in Sorting by Replacement Selecting
In the replacement-selecting technique of sorting,
one is interested in the ratio L(j) of the
expected length of the j-th sequence generated by the
technique to the number of memory cells used.
Using complex-variable theory, it is shown that L(j)
-> 2 and that, asymptotically, the average interval
between sign changes of L(j)-2 is 2.6662.
