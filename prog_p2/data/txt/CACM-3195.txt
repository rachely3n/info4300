Reiteration of ACM Policy Toward Standardization
The periodic change in officers, chairman and editors which usually follows
as election occasionally results in a change in policy. In the case of this
department there is no radical change, but this is nevertheless the proper time
to reiterate ans underline ACM's policy with respect to standardization in the
computer area.
