Register Allocation Via Usage Counts
This paper introduces the notion of usage counts,
shows how usage counts can be developed by
algorithms that eliminate redundant computations, and
describes how usage counts can provide the basis
for register allocation.  The paper compares register
allocation based on usage counts to other commonly
used register allocation techniques, and presents evidence
which shows that the usage count technique
is significantly better than these other techniques.
