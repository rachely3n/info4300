Wengert's Numerical Method for Partial Derivatives,
Orbit Determination and Quasilinearization
In a recent article in the Communications
of the ACM, R. Wengert suggested a technique for
machine evaluation of the partial derivatives of a function
given in analytical form.  In solving non-linear
boundary-value problems using quasilinearization many
partial derivatives must be formed analytically
and then evaluated numerically.  Wengert's method appears
very attractive from the programming viewpoint
equations which might not otherwise be undertaken.
