Programming by Questionnaire: An Effective Way To Use Decision Tables
Programming by questionnaire combines aspects
of decision table programming and general purpose
programming by using decision tables to construct an application
program through the selection of certain
source statements from a predefined file.  It is proposed
that programming by questionnairies a useful
compromise between general and special purpose programming
for a significant class of large scale problems.
The elements of the approach are discussed
an existing application is described.
