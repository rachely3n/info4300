Organizing Matrices and Matrix Operations for Paged Memory Systems
Matrix representations and operations are examined
for the purpose of minimizing the page faulting
occurring in a paged memory system.  It is shown that
carefully designed matrix algorithms can lead to
enormous savings in the number of page faults occurring
when only a small part of the total matrix can
be in main memory at one time.  Examination of addition,
multiplication, and inversion algorithms shows
that a partitioned matrix representation (i.e. one submatrix
or partition per page) in most cases induced
fewer page faults than a row-by-row representation.
The number of page-pulls required by these matrix
manipulation algorithms is also studied as a function
of the number of pages of main memory available
to the algorithm.
