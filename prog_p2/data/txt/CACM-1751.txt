The Working Set Model for Program Behavior
Probably the most basic reason behind the absence
of a general treatment of resource allocation
in modern computer systems is an adequate model for
program behavior.  In this paper a new model, the
"working set model," is developed. The working set
of pages associated with a process, defined to be
the collection of its most recently used pages, provides
knowledge vital to the dynamic management of
paged memories.  "Process" and "working set" are shown to
be manifestations of the same ongoing computational
activity; then "processor demand" and "memory demand"
are defined; and resource allocation is formulated
as the problem of balancing demands against available equipment.
