Macro Instruction Extensions of Compiler Languages
Macroinstruction compilers constructed from
a small set of functions can be made extremely
powerful.  In particular, conditional assembly, nested
definitions, and parenthetical notation serve
to make a compiler capable of accepting very
general extensions to its ground language.
