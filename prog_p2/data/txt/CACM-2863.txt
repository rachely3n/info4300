VMIN-An Optimal Variable-Space Page Replacement Algorithm
A criterion for comparing variable space page
replacement algorithms is presented.  An optimum
page replacement algorithm, called VMIN, is described and
shown to be optimum with respect to this criterion.
The results of simulating VMIN, Denning's working set,
and the page partitioning replacement algorithms
on five virtual memory programs are presented to demonstrate
the improvement possible over the known
realizable variable space algorithms.
