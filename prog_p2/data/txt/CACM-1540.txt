An Algorithm for Class Scheduling With Section Preference
An algorithm for assignment of students to classes
in a fixed time schedule that allows students
to give a preference for sections within courses is given.
If consistent with the objective of balanced
sections, these preferences will be honored.  The algorithm
is more stochastic than Monte Carlo in nature.
Results are given that compare it to a nonpreference assignment algorithm.
