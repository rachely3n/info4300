Syntax-Directed Documentation For PL 360
The language PL 360, together with its phrase structure grammar, is used as a
concrete basis for illustrating an idea called syntax-directed documentation.
This idea is (1) to use the phrase structure of a program to define the
structure of a formal documentation for that program; (2) to use the syntactic
types and identifiers in the resulting structure to trigger the automatic
formation of questions to the programmer, whose answers will
become part of that documentation; and (3) to provide automatic storage
and retrieval facilities so that other programmers who want
to understand or modify the program can access the resulting documentation,
which is cross-indexed in various ways by syntactic types
and objects.  A small PL 360 program, already found
in the literature, is worked out as an example.
