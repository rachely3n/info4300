Reducing the Retrieval Time of Scatter Storage Techniques
A new method for entering and retrieving information
in a hash table is described.  The method
is intended to be efficient if most entries are looked
up several times.  The expected number of probes
to look up an entry, predicted theoretically and verified
by Monte Carlo experiments, is considerably
less than for other comparable methods if the table
is nearly full.  An example of a possible Fortran
implementation is given.
