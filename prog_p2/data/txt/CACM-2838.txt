Analysis of an Algorithm for Real Time Garbage Collection
A real time garbage collection system avoids
suspending the operations of a list processor
for the long times that garbage collection normally requires
by performing garbage collection on a second
processor in parallel with list processing operations,
or on a single processor time-shared with them.
Algorithms for recovering discarded list structures in
this manner are presented and analyzed to determine
sufficient conditions under which the list processor never
needs to wait on the collector.  These techniques
are shown to require at most twice as much processing
power as regular garbage collectors, if they are
used efficiently.  The average behavior of the program
is shown to be very nearly equal to the worst-case
performance, so that the sufficient conditions are also
suitable for measuring the typical behavior of
the algorithm.
