A Language for Treating Graphs
A language for the representation of graph is described, and the formulation of
graph operations such as node and/or link deletion or insertion, union,
intersection, comparison, and traversal of graphs is given.  Graphs
are represented by linked lists.  The language is syntactically defined
as an extension to ALGOL 60, and it is translated into ALGOL
by means of a syntax-driven compiler.  Application areas for this language are
operation research, network problems, control theory, traffic problems, etc.
