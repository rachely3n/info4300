I've put default files from project 1, still trying to figure out what exactly we need. Working on part A, i know how to do it I think, but still trying to figure out the details of implementation. Piazza seems to be a good source since other people have already suffered a lot and figured everything out. Keep me posted. 


### update
Making a bit of progress on part A!
